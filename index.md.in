# Hi, I'm Nick Derr
I use math to model and study systems in physics and biology at [MIT](https://math.mit.edu), where I'm an Instructor. I completed my PhD in Applied Math at [Harvard](https://www.seas.harvard.edu), where I was advised by [Chris Rycroft](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~chr). Before that, I majored in [Applied Math, Engineering and Physics](https://amep.math.wisc.edu) at the University of Wisconsin and did [Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) at Cambridge University.

You can [click here for my CV](/assets/files/cv.pdf), or check out the [[About Me]](/biography.html) and [[Research]](/research.html) sections to learn more. My publications are listed below. Outside of math, I enjoy distance running, crossword puzzles and mass-market paperbacks.

My email is derr at mit dot edu. Thanks for visiting!
