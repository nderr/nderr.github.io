# Hi, I'm Nick Derr
I use math to model and study systems in physics and biology at [MIT Math](https://math.mit.edu). I completed my PhD at [Harvard](https://www.seas.harvard.edu), where I was advised by [Chris Rycroft](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~chr). Before that, I majored in [Applied Math, Engineering and Physics](https://amep.math.wisc.edu) at the University of Wisconsin and did [Part III Maths](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) at Cambridge University. I enjoy long-distance running, crossword puzzles and old paperbacks.


[My PhD research](/research.html) focused on modeling systems with elements of fluid--structure interaction, including [eroding porous media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02997) and [simple swimmers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03669). I also developed high-performance computational methods for similar settings, such as [suspensions of soft immersed bodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00095) and [active gels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14379). [Download my CV](/assets/files/cv.pdf) or check out the [About Me](/biography.html) and [Research](/research.html) sections to learn more.
