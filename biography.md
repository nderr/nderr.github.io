I am a PhD Candidate in Applied Math at Harvard University, where I work with [Prof. Chris Rycroft](people.seas.harvard.edu/~chr). I use continuum mechanics to model physical and biological systems such as cytoskeletal gels, reciprocal swimmers, and branching erosion patterns. My work combines high-performance computation with simplified models because I believe the two approaches together are more than the sum of their parts. Simplified models reveal the underlying structure of a solution and give context to computational results, and efficient numerical methods allow for the evaluation of highly complex or intractable models.

I am supported by the [NSF-Simons Quantitative Biology Center at Harvard](https://quantbio.harvard.edu). Previously, I was an [NDSEG Fellow](https://ndseg.sysplus.com).

I completed [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) at Cambridge University as a member of Churchill College. My essay, Artificial phoretic microswimmers, is [here](files/essay.pdf). During this time, I was supported by a Marcus L. Urann Fellowship from [The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi](https://phikappaphi.org).

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with majors in Applied Math, Engineering and Physics ([AMEP](https://amep.math.wisc.edu)) and Astronomy-Physics. I also completed certificates in Computer Science and Business and played trumpet in the [marching band](https://badgerband.wisc.edu). I won the [Theodore Herfurth Award](https://awards.advising.wisc.edu/all-scholarships/theodore-herfurth-and-teddy-kubly-awards/), awarded each year to the two graduating students who “made the most effective use of their time at UW-Madison.” I performed research on the lunar exosphere with the support of a [Hilldale Fellowship](https://awards.advising.wisc.edu/all-scholarships/hilldale-undergraduatefaculty-research-fellowship/).
