# About Me

My work combines high-performance computation with simplified analytical models because I believe the two yield more than the sum of their parts. Simplified models reveal the underlying structure of a solution and give context to computational results, and efficient numerical methods allow for the evaluation of highly complex or intractable models.

I received my PhD in Applied Math from Harvard University, where I was advised by [Prof. Chris Rycroft](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chr). I used continuum mechanics to model physical and biological systems such as cytoskeletal gels, reciprocal swimmers, and branching erosion patterns.  During my PhD I was supported by the [NSF-Simons Quantitative Biology Center at Harvard](https://quantbio.harvard.edu) and an [NDSEG Fellowship](https://ndseg.sysplus.com).

I completed [Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) at Cambridge University as a member of Churchill College. My essay, *Artificial phoretic microswimmers*, is [here](/assets/files/essay.pdf). During this time, I was supported by a Marcus L. Urann Fellowship from [Phi Kappa Phi](https://phikappaphi.org).

I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with majors in Applied Math, Engineering and Physics ([AMEP](https://amep.math.wisc.edu)) and Astronomy-Physics. I also completed certificates in Computer Science and Business and played trumpet in the [marching band](https://badgerband.wisc.edu). I won the [Theodore Herfurth Award](https://awards.advising.wisc.edu/all-scholarships/theodore-herfurth-and-teddy-kubly-awards/), awarded each year to the two graduating students who made the most effective use of their time at UW-Madison. I performed research on the lunar exosphere with the support of a [Hilldale Fellowship](https://awards.advising.wisc.edu/all-scholarships/hilldale-undergraduatefaculty-research-fellowship/).
