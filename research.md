My research centers on interactions between fluid and solid aspects of systems, often in porous, deforming systems arising in biological contexts. Here are a few of my past and present projects.

### Erosion dynamics
Branching patterns can be seen in nature in a wide variety of contexts, from small biological systems (venation systems) to large geophysical settings (river systems.) In [this paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.158002) [\[arxiv\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02997), we proposed a simple mechanical model for erosion and showed that the resulting dynamics yielded branching patterns such as these.
