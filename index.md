I use math to model and study systems in physics and biology.

This fall, I am starting as an instructor at [MIT](https://math.mit.edu). I completed my PhD in Applied Math at [Harvard](https://www.seas.harvard.edu), where I was advised by [Chris Rycroft](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chr).

My email is derr at g dot harvard dot edu.

Thanks for visiting!
