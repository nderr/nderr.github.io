I use math to model and study systems in physics and biology.

I am completing my PhD in Applied Math from Harvard University, where I work with [Chris Rycroft](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chr). In Fall 2022, I am joining the [MIT Mathematics Department](https://math.mit.edu) as an Instructor in Applied Math, where I'll conduct research and teach.

My CV is [here](/assets/files/cv.pdf), and a longer bio is [here](/biography.html).

[Here](/research.html) are some examples of my research.

My email is derr at g dot harvard dot edu.

Thanks for visiting!
