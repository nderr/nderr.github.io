I use math to model and study systems in biology and physics.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the group of [Chris Rycroft](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chr) at Harvard. I am joining the [MIT Mathematics Department](https://math.mit.edu) as an Instructor in Applied Math in Fall 2022.

My CV is [here](files/cv.pdf). A longer bio is [here](./biography.html).

Thanks for visiting!
