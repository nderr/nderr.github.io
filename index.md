I use math to model and study systems in biology and physics.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the group of [Chris Rycroft](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chr) at Harvard. In July 2022, I am joining the [MIT Mathematics Department](https://math.mit.edu) as an Instructor in Applied Math.

My CV is [here](/assets/files/cv.pdf), and a longer bio is [here](/biography.html).

[Here](/research.html) are some examples of my research.

Thanks for visiting!
